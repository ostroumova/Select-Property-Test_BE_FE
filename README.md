This is test project Select Properties

I have created 2 endpoints GET and POST to read and post property to the basic in-memory storage.
Then render you will see the availible properties on the frontend.
You will see that the POST request will work and will add new property in the property array On the POSTMAN
One thing that I haven't finished is uploading the image from the frontend.
I will work on that durung the week.
